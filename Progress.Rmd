## October 2, 2018

Initial progress is slow. I have something for each week (although some weeks are more developed than others). Currently working on Week 3 my texts
- Lewis Carroll texts

Done:
1. unnest_tokens(): make text into list of words
2. Tidy the works (perhaps before we unnest)
    - but this might just be for that specific library janeaustenr
3. data(stop_words), anti_join(stop_words): removes stop words from list 
4. count(word, sort = TRUE) : count words to store in list

Currently:
Count looks off, need to clean up (add custom stop_words)
Thinking about removing the math papers by Carroll
Also thinking about removing all chapter titles (?)
- will this effect the word frequency greatly?
