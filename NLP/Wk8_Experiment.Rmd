```{r}
library(NLP)
library(openNLP)
library(RWeka)
library(rJava)
library(magrittr)

## Basic Tokenization

```{r}
# made the folder path within the homework folder
bio <- readLines("data/nlp/anb-jarena-lee.txt")
print(bio)
```

```{r}
bio <- paste(bio, collapse = " ")
print(bio)
```

```{r}
bio <- as.String(bio)
```
